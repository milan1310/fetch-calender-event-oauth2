In this project i have implemented google Oauth2.0 mechanisam withou taking help of any third party or strandard libray

#### Two end points are used

* this app is currently in testing mode so if you want to test this app send me your email address i will add you as a testing account *

* using this api you can fetch all the events of your google calendar `it will give the response in json formated view inside browser`
-------------

#### To test this API follow this steps
 - create `cert.pem` & `key.pem` file in side your root directory {Because i have implemented this nodejs api on https with localhost secure network architecture}
